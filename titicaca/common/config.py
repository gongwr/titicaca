A rough estimation can be done by multiplying the number of
``max_workers`` with an average image size (e.g 500MB). The image
size estimation should be done based on the average size in your
deployment. Note that depending on the tasks running you may need
to multiply this number by some factor depending on what the task
does. For example, you may want to double the available size if
image conversion is enabled. All this being said, remember these
are just estimations and you should do them based on the worst

Secure hashing algorithm used for computing the 'os_hash_value' property.

This option configures the Titicaca "multihash", which consists of two
image properties: the 'os_hash_algo' and the 'os_hash_value'.  The
'os_hash_algo' will be populated by the value of this configuration
option, and the 'os_hash_value' will be populated by the hexdigest computed
when the algorithm is applied to the uploaded or imported image data.

The value must be a valid secure hash algorithm name recognized by the
python 'hashlib' library.  You can determine what these are by examining
the 'hashlib.algorithms_available' data member of the version of the
library being used in your Titicaca installation.  For interoperability
purposes, however, we recommend that you use the set of secure hash
names supplied by the 'hashlib.algorithms_guaranteed' data member because
those algorithms are guaranteed to be supported by the 'hashlib' library
on all platforms.  Thus, any image consumer using 'hashlib' locally should
be able to verify the 'os_hash_value' of the image.

The default value of 'sha512' is a performant secure hash algorithm.

If this option is misconfigured, any attempts to store image data will fail.
